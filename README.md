library(wcfish)
```

Datasets
---------

The package includes the following West Coast fisheries datasets (listed below):

CDFW datasets
- California commercial fishing ports: ?ports
- California commercial fishing blocks shapefile: ?blocks
- Annual commercial landings by source and species: ?cdfw_waters
- Annual commercial landings by port and species: ?cdfw_port
- Annual number of licensed commercial fishers by area of residence: ?cdfw_n_comm_fishers
- Annual number of registered commercial fishing vessels by length class: ?cdfw_n_comm_vessels_length
- Annual number of registered commercial fishing vessels by port complex: ?cdfw_n_comm_vessels_port
- Annual number of registered commercial fishing vessels: ?cdfw_n_comm_vessels
- Annual CPFV landings by port complex and species: ?cdfw_cpfv
- Annual CPFV participation and effort by port complex and species: ?cdfw_cpfv_effort


A dataset can be accessed and inspected as in the following example:

``` r
# See dataset metadata by typing a question mark and the dataset name
?wcfish::blocks

# Store the dataset in an object of your own choosing as follows:
blocks_sf <- wcfish::blocks
```


Functions
---------

The package implements miscellaneous functions including functions to:

- Check spelling of common names: `?check_names`
- Reverse the format of common names (e.g., "Crab, Dungeness" to "Dungeness crab"): `?reverse_names`
- Convert common names to a common format (i.e., all to "regular" or "reverse" formats): `?convert_names`
- Harmonize common names and scientific names: `?harmonize_names`
